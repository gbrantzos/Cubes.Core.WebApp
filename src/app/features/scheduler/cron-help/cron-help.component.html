    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      cron is a UNIX tool that has been around for a long time, so its scheduling capabilities are powerful and proven.
      The CronTrigger class is based on the scheduling capabilities of cron.
    </p>
    <p>
      CronTrigger uses “cron expressions”, which are able to create firing schedules such as: “At 8:00am every Monday
      through Friday” or “At 1:30am every last Friday of the month”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cron expressions are powerful, but can be pretty confusing. This tutorial aims to take some of the mystery out of
      creating a cron expression, giving users a resource which they can visit before having to ask in a forum or
      mailing list.
    </p>

    <h3 id="format">Format</h3>
    <p>
      A cron expression is a string comprised of 6 or 7 fields separated by white space. Fields can contain any of the
      allowed values, along with various combinations of the allowed special characters for that field. The fields are
      as follows:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>
            <strong>Field Name</strong>
          </th>
          <th>
            <strong>Mandatory</strong>
          </th>
          <th>
            <strong>Allowed Values</strong>
          </th>
          <th>
            <strong>Allowed Special Characters</strong>
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Seconds</td>
          <td>YES</td>
          <td>0-59</td>
          <td>, - * /</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Minutes</td>
          <td>YES</td>
          <td>0-59</td>
          <td>, - * /</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Hours</td>
          <td>YES</td>
          <td>0-23</td>
          <td>, - * /</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Day of month</td>
          <td>YES</td>
          <td>1-31</td>
          <td>, - * ? / L W</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Month</td>
          <td>YES</td>
          <td>1-12 or JAN-DEC</td>
          <td>, - * /</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Day of week</td>
          <td>YES</td>
          <td>1-7 or SUN-SAT</td>
          <td>, - * ? / L #</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Year</td>
          <td>NO</td>
          <td>empty, 1970-2099</td>
          <td>, - * /</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>So cron expressions can be as simple as this: * * * * ? *</p>
    <p>or more complex, like this: 0/5 14,18,3-39,52 * ? JAN,MAR,SEP MON-FRI 2002-2010</p>

    <h3 id="special-characters">Special characters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>*</strong> (“all values”) - used to select all values within a field. For example, “” in the minute
        field means *“every minute”.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>?</strong> (“no specific value”) - useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields in
        which the character is allowed, but not the other. For example, if I want my trigger to fire on a particular day
        of the month (say, the 10th), but don’t care what day of the week that happens to be, I would put “10” in the
        day-of-month field, and “?” in the day-of-week field. See the examples below for clarification.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>-</strong> - used to specify ranges. For example, “10-12” in the hour field means “the hours 10, 11 and
        12”.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>,</strong> - used to specify additional values. For example, “MON,WED,FRI” in the day-of-week field
        means “the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday”.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>/</strong> - used to specify increments. For example, “0/15” in the seconds field means “the seconds 0,
        15, 30, and 45”. And “5/15” in the seconds field means “the seconds 5, 20, 35, and 50”. You can also specify ‘/’
        after the ‘’ character - in this case ‘’ is equivalent to having ‘0’ before the ‘/’. ‘1/3’ in the day-of-month
        field means “fire every 3 days starting on the first day of the month”.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>L</strong> (“last”) - has different meaning in each of the two fields in which it is allowed. For
        example, the value “L” in the day-of-month field means “the last day of the month” - day 31 for January, day 28
        for February on non-leap years. If used in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means “7” or “SAT”. But if
        used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means “the last xxx day of the month” - for example “6L”
        means “the last friday of the month”. You can also specify an offset from the last day of the month, such as
        “L-3” which would mean the third-to-last day of the calendar month. When using the ‘L’ option, it is important
        not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you’ll get confusing/unexpected results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>W</strong> (“weekday”) - used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an
        example, if you were to specify “15W” as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: “the nearest
        weekday to the 15th of the month”. So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th. If
        the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on
        Tuesday the 15th. However if you specify “1W” as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the
        trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not ‘jump’ over the boundary of a month’s days. The ‘W’
        character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days. ** The ‘L’
        and ‘W’ characters can also be combined in the day-of-month field to yield ‘LW’, which translates to
        <em>“last weekday of the month”</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>#</strong> - used to specify “the nth” XXX day of the month. For example, the value of “6#3” in the
        day-of-week field means “the third Friday of the month” (day 6 = Friday and “#3” = the 3rd one in the month).
        Other examples: “2#1” = the first Monday of the month and “4#5” = the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note that if
        you specify “#5” and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month, then no firing will occur that month.
        ** The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are not case sensitive. MON is the same as
        mon.

        Be careful when setting fire times between the hours of the morning when “daylight savings” changes occur in
        your locale (for US locales, this would typically be the hour before and after 2:00 AM - because the time shift
        can cause a skip or a repeat depending on whether the time moves back or jumps forward. You may find
